VICIDIAL Server Trunks allows you to restrict the outgoing lines that are used on this server for campaign dialing on a per-campaign basis. You have the option to reserve a specific number of lines to be used by only one campaign as well as allowing that campaign to run over its reserved lines into whatever lines remain open, as long at the total lines used by vicidial on this server is less than the Max VICIDIAL Trunks setting. Not having any of these records will allow the campaign that dials the line first to have as many lines as it can get under the Max VICIDIAL Trunks setting||
VICIDIAL Balance Dialing -<\/B> Setting this field to Y will allow the server to place balance calls for campaigns in VICIDIAL so that the defined dial level can be met even if there are no agents logged into that campaign on this server. Default is N||
VICIDIAL Balance Offlimits -<\/B> This setting defines the number of trunks to not allow VICIDIAL balance dialing to use. For example if you have 40 max vicidial trunks and balance offlimits is set to 10 you will only be able to use 30 trunk lines for VICIDIAL balance dialing. Default is 0||
