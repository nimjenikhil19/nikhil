In-Group Manual Dial||
In-Group Manual Dial Select||
This feature allows you to enable the ability for agents to place manual dial outbound calls that are logged as in-group calls assigned to a specific in-group. The MANUAL_DIAL option allows the placing of phone calls out through an In-Group to the agent placing the call. The NO_DIAL option allows the agent to log time on a call that does not exist, as if it were a real call, this is often used for logging email or faxing time. The BOTH option will allow both call and no-call in-group dialing. The default is DISABLED||
This option is only active if the above In-Group Manual Dial feature is not DISABLED. This option restricts the selectable In-Groups that the agent can place In-Group Manual Dial calls through. CAMPAIGN_SELECTED will show only the in-groups that the campaign has set as allowable in-groups. ALL_USER_GROUP will show all of the in-groups that are viewable to the members of the user group that the agent belongs to||
Dial In-Group CID||
If the agent campaign allows for Manual In-Group Dialing, this caller ID number will be sent as the outgoing CID of the phone call if it is populated, overriding the campaign settings and list CID override setting. Default is empty||
You can also use LTMG or XFTAMM as statuses to trigger an automatic transfer to the Leave-Voicemail option||
Send to Answering Machine Message||
Safe Harbor Audio Field||
This optional setting allows you to define a field in the list that the system will use as the audio filename for each lead in place of the Safe Harbor Audio file. If this is set to DISABLED the Safe Harbor Audio file will always be used. The system will do no validation to make sure that the audio file exists other than to make sure the value of the field is at least one character, so if you want a lead to use the default Safe harbor Audio then you just set the field value in the lead to empty. You can use the pipe character to link multiple audio files together in the field value for each lead. Default is DISABLED. Here is the list of fields that can be used for this setting||
