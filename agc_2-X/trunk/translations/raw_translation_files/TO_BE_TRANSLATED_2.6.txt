In-Group Manual Dial||
In-Group Manual Dial Select||
This feature allows you to enable the ability for agents to place manual dial outbound calls that are logged as in-group calls assigned to a specific in-group. The MANUAL_DIAL option allows the placing of phone calls out through an In-Group to the agent placing the call. The NO_DIAL option allows the agent to log time on a call that does not exist, as if it were a real call, this is often used for logging email or faxing time. The BOTH option will allow both call and no-call in-group dialing. The default is DISABLED||
This option is only active if the above In-Group Manual Dial feature is not DISABLED. This option restricts the selectable In-Groups that the agent can place In-Group Manual Dial calls through. CAMPAIGN_SELECTED will show only the in-groups that the campaign has set as allowable in-groups. ALL_USER_GROUP will show all of the in-groups that are viewable to the members of the user group that the agent belongs to||
Dial In-Group CID||
If the agent campaign allows for Manual In-Group Dialing, this caller ID number will be sent as the outgoing CID of the phone call if it is populated, overriding the campaign settings and list CID override setting. Default is empty||
You can also use LTMG or XFTAMM as statuses to trigger an automatic transfer to the Leave-Voicemail option||
Send to Answering Machine Message||
Safe Harbor Audio Field||
This optional setting allows you to define a field in the list that the system will use as the audio filename for each lead in place of the Safe Harbor Audio file. If this is set to DISABLED the Safe Harbor Audio file will always be used. The system will do no validation to make sure that the audio file exists other than to make sure the value of the field is at least one character, so if you want a lead to use the default Safe harbor Audio then you just set the field value in the lead to empty. You can use the pipe character to link multiple audio files together in the field value for each lead. Default is DISABLED. Here is the list of fields that can be used for this setting||
Call Menu Qualify Enabled||
This setting enables the option in Call Menus to put a SQL qualification on the people that hear that call menu. For more information on how that feature works, view the help for Call Menus. Default is 0 for disabled||
Qualify SQL||
This field allows you to input SQL - Structured Query Language - database fragments, like with Filters, to determine whether this call menu should play for the caller or not. This feature only works if the call has the callerIDname set prior to being sent to this call menu, either as an outbound survey transfer, or through the use of a drop call menu for an In-Group call. If there is a match, the call will proceed as normal. If there is no match, the call will go to the D option or the invalid option if no D option is set. You cannot use single-quotes in this field, only double-quotes if they are needed. Default is empty for disabled||
Admin List Counts||
This setting allows you to disable the list counts that appear on the Lists listing and the Campaign modify screens. Default is 1 for enabled||
The Y_API_LAUNCH option can be used with the agent API to launch the webphone in a separate Iframe or window||
If the option has BLANK at the end, then users are allowed to dial leads with no owner defined in addition to owner defined leads||
Voicemail Greeting||
This optional setting allows you to define a voicemail greeting audio file from the audio store. Default is blank||
Allow Voicemail Greeting Chooser||
If this setting is enabled it will allow you to choose an audio file from the audio store to be played as the voicemail greeting to a specific voicemail box. Default is 0 for disabled||
File to Delete||
Agent Pause After Next Call Link||
This option if enabled will display a link on the agent screen that will let the agent go on pause automatically after they hang up their next call. Default is DISABLED||
Owner Populate||
If this is enabled and the owner field of the lead is blank, the owner field for the lead will populate with the user ID of the agent that handles the call first. Default is DISABLED||
This field allows you to customize the name of the recording when Campaign recording is ONDEMAND or ALLCALLS. The allowed variables are||
The default is FULLDATE_AGENT and would look like this 20051020-103108_6666. Another example is CAMPAIGN_TINYDATE_CUSTPHONE which would look like this TESTCAMP_51020103108_3125551212. Te resulting filename must be less than 90 characters in length||
This field will override the Campaign Recording Filenaming Scheme unless it is set to NONE. The allowed variables are||
Audit Comments||
This option allows comments to be moved to an audit table. No longer editable, but viewable along with the date-time-creator of each comment. Default is N. This is a part of the Quality Control Add-On||
