In-Group Manual Dial||
In-Group Manual Dial Select||
This feature allows you to enable the ability for agents to place manual dial outbound calls that are logged as in-group calls assigned to a specific in-group. The MANUAL_DIAL option allows the placing of phone calls out through an In-Group to the agent placing the call. The NO_DIAL option allows the agent to log time on a call that does not exist, as if it were a real call, this is often used for logging email or faxing time. The BOTH option will allow both call and no-call in-group dialing. The default is DISABLED||
This option is only active if the above In-Group Manual Dial feature is not DISABLED. This option restricts the selectable In-Groups that the agent can place In-Group Manual Dial calls through. CAMPAIGN_SELECTED will show only the in-groups that the campaign has set as allowable in-groups. ALL_USER_GROUP will show all of the in-groups that are viewable to the members of the user group that the agent belongs to||
