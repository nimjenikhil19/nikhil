If you want to allow Consultative Transfers, a fronter to a closer, you can place CXFER as one of the number-to-dial presets and the proper dialstring will be sent to do a Local Consultative Transfer, then the agent can just LEAVE-3WAY-CALL and move on to their next call. If you want to allow Blind transfers of customers to a VICIDIAL AGI script for logging or an IVR, then place AXFER in the number-to-dial field. You can also specify an custom extension after the AXFER or CXFER, for instance if you want to do Internal Consultative transfers instead of Local you would put CXFER90009 in the number-to-dial field||
