If you want to allow Consultative Transfers, a fronter to a closer, you can place CXFER as one of the number-to-dial presets and the proper dialstring will be sent to do a Local Consultative Transfer, then the agent can just LEAVE-3WAY-CALL and move on to their next call. If you want to allow Blind transfers of customers to a VICIDIAL AGI script for logging or an IVR, then place AXFER in the number-to-dial field. You can also specify an custom extension after the AXFER or CXFER, for instance if you want to do Internal Consultative transfers instead of Local you would put CXFER90009 in the number-to-dial field||
System Performance -<\/B> Setting this option to Y will enable logging of system performance stats for the server machine including system load, system processes and Asterisk channels in use. Default is N||
Server Logs -<\/B> Setting this option to Y will enable logging of all VICIDIAL related scripts to their text log files. Setting this to N will stop writing logs to files for these processes, also the screen logging of asterisk will be disabled if this is set to N when Asterisk is started. Default is Y||
AGI Output -<\/B> Setting this option to NONE will disable output from all VICIDIAL related AGI scripts. Setting this to STDERR will send the AGI output to the Asterisk CLI. Setting this to FILE will send the output to a file in the logs directory. Setting this to BOTH will send output to both the Asterisk CLI and a log file. Default is FILE||
Recording Delay -<\/B> For ALLCALLS and ALLFORCE recording only. This setting will delay the starting of the recording on all calls for the number of seconds specified in this field. Default is 0||
Omit Phone Code -<\/B> This field allows you to leave out the phone_code field while dialing within VICIDIAL. For instance if you are dialing in the UK from the UK you would have 44 in as your phone_code field for all leads, but you just want to dial 10 digits in your dialplan extensions.conf to place calls instead of 44 then 10 digits. Default is N
Campaign Recording -<\/B> This menu allows you to choose what level of recording is allowed on this campaign. NEVER will disable recording on the client. ONDEMAND is the default and allows the agent to start and stop recording as needed. ALLCALLS will start recording on the client whenever a call is sent to an agent. ALLFORCE will start recording on the client whenever a call is sent to an agent giving the agent no option to stop recording. For ALLCALLS and ALLFORCE there is an option to use the Recording Delay to cut down on very short recordings and recude system load
