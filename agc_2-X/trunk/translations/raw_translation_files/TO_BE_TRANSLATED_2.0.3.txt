ADAPT OVERRIDE||
The ADAPT OVERRIDE checkbox allows you to force a new dial level even though the dial method is in an ADAPT mode. This is useful if there is a dramatic shift in the quality of leads and you want to drastically change the dial_level manually.||
There are two special HotKey options that you can use in conjunction with Alternate Phone number dialing, ALTPH2 - Alternate Phone Hot Dial and ADDR3-----Address3 Hot Dial allow an agent to use a hotkey to hangup their call, stay on the same lead, and dial another contact number from that lead.||
