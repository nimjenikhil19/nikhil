OUTBOUND LIST ORDERING AND MIXING				  2007-05-02

** THIS NEW OPTIONAL LIST ORDERING FEATURE IS PLANNED FOR THE 2.0.4 RELEASE **

This document will outline the new optional feature within VICIDIAL outbound dialing that will allow for both list ordering and mixing while dialing outbound vicidial campaigns.


The Agent Side:
Nothing changes


The Admin Side:
The lists used in a VICIDIAL campaign will be moved to a different tab in the Campaign Modification screen to allow for easier quick modification of the lists used and their order and mixing percentage. Also, a new field will be added to vicidial_campaigns table and a new vicidial_campaign_lists table will be created to store the information for list ordering and mixing:
ALTER TABLE vicidial_campaigns ADD list_order_mix VARCHAR(20) default 'DISABLED';

 CREATE TABLE vicidial_campaign_lists (
vcl_id VARCHAR(20) PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
vcl_name VARCHAR(50),
campaign_id VARCHAR(8),
list_mix TEXT,
status ENUM('ACTIVE','INACTIVE') default 'INACTIVE',
index (campaign_id)
);



The Server Side:

MORE TO COME...
