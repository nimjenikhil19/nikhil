ALTERNATE NUMBER DIALING Summary and Overview                         2007-01-15

*** ALTERNATE NUMBER DIALING IN AUTODIAL MODE WILL BE ADDED IN THE 2.0.3 RELEASE ***

This document will outline the methods used to automatically dial the alt_phone and/or address3 fields containing phone numbers for a lead while in Auto-dial modes(RATIO or ADAPT*). This feature does not function for leads dialed with the MANUAL dial_method.

If you will be using automatic alt number dialing, it is strongly recommended that you filter your alternate numbers to be the proper length, and remove any non-numeric characters from those fields.



First, a new field in vicidial_campaigns was needed to tell the dialer that it should look for contact numbers in the alt_phone and/or address3 fields if a call to a regular number results in a no-contact(NA/B/DC/N)

ALTER TABLE vicidial_campaigns ADD auto_alt_dial ENUM('NONE','ALT_ONLY','ADDR3_ONLY','ALT_AND_ADDR3') default 'NONE';


Second, a new field in vicidial_auto_calls was needed to tell the dialer that when this call is terminated as no-contact(NA/B/DC/N), it needs to try dialing the next alternate number(s). This field is populated accordingly: 
- If the main phone_number is currently being dialed, the alt_dial field will be MAIN
- If the alt_phone is being dialed, ALT
- If the address3 field is being dialed, ADDR3
- If the campaign has AUTO_ALT_DIAL set to NONE or the alt numbers are invalid, then this field will also be set to NONE
This tells the scripts handling the call termination what needs to be done with the call status and what number(if any) it should place in the hopper next.

ALTER TABLE vicidial_auto_calls ADD alt_dial ENUM('NONE','MAIN','ALT','ADDR3') default 'NONE';





STEPS OF AN AUTO-ALT-DIAL CALL:

1. When a call to a lead's main phone_number is placed by AST_VDauto_dial.pl or AST_VDauto_dial_FILL.pl and the auto_alt_dial field is NOT set to NONE, a flag will be set in the vicidial_auto_calls field as MAIN to note that this lead needs to be called again under it's alternate number(s) if it is terminated under a no-connect status(NA/B/DC/N).

2. What happens when one of these calls is terminated:
	2a. If the call has an alt_dial value of MAIN or ALT and went to an agent and was defined as no-contact(NA/B/DC/N) then the vdc_db_query.php script will immediately place that lead back into the vicidial_hopper to be dialed under it's alternate phone number or addr3.

	2b. If call has an alt_dial value of MAIN or ALT and was terminated as no-contact by no-answer(NA/B/DC) then the VDhangup process will immediately place that lead back into the vicidial_hopper to be dialed under it's alternate phone number.

3. When the alt_phone is dialed of the same lead, the alt_dial flag in vicidial_auto_calls will be set to ALT, then repeat step 2

4. When the address3 field is dialed from the same lead, the alt_dial flag is set to ADDR3

5. When a call is terminated in auto-dial mode and the number dialed was not the main phone_number, the status will not be changed in the vicidial_list table unless the status is a connect status and it came from an agent.
